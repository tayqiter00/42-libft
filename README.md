# 42-libft

This repository is my attempt at the very first project of the 42 school: Libft. The aim of this project is to recreate some of the commonly used functions from the C library. Note: these aren't guaranteed to pass Moulinette's check! They are not 100% written in accordance to the norm anyway.
